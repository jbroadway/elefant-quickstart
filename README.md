# Elefant Quickstart for Pagoda Box

This is a quickstart for the [Elefant CMS](http://www.elefantcms.com/) on the
[Pagoda Box](http://www.pagodabox.com/) PHP cloud hosting service.

After you run it, log into your new site at `/admin` with the email `you@example.com`
and the password `ChangeMe` and change your password under Tools > Users. These can
also be changed before your first deployment by editing the Boxfile.
